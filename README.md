 assisten give 56 cards to the randome people and tell take 5 cards.assistant hide one card and show other 4 card to magician, magician find the hiden card. How the magician (the guy with the white t-shirt) 
guess the hidden card? What is the secret behind it? 
It turns out that the order in which the Assistant reveals the cards tells the Magician what 
the fifth card is! The Assistant needs to be able to decide which of the cards is going to be 
hidden – he or she cannot allow the audience to pick the hidden card out of the five cards 
that the audience picks. Here’s one way that the Assistant and the Magician can work 
together.

Exercise 01 
Write a computer program using C++ to assist the helper of the magician to decide 
the hidden card and order the remaining cards. Five random cards should be taken 
as user inputs.

Exercise 02 
Write a computer program using C++ to assist the magician to decide on what is the 
hidden card based on the four cards he can see. Four random cards should be taken 
as user inputs.
